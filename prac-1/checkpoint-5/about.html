            <p class="bio-text"> Hello, my name is Qiurui Cui and I love exploring nature. 
                Having a walk on the beach, wandering around the park and 
                listening to songs of birds can really help me recharge. I also like writing. That is 
                why I am writing right now to make the paragraph look justified and aligned. It's like 
                I am about to make up something in order to write more. Now let me look if the page is 
                justified or not. If not, I will write more to make it look justified. Now it's almost
                11 pm, and I am really sleepy.
